Welcome to my GitHub Repository! My name is Ilja Kantorovitch, and I am a PhD candidate at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona.

My research focuses on information frictions in financial markets and the macroeconomy. I am interested in understanding how information production and belief formation influence outcomes in financial markets and, subsequently, in the macroeconomy.

I am currently on the job market and will be available for interviews at the virtual EEA meeting in December 2020 and the virtual ASSA meeting in January 2021.

You can download here my Job Market Paper (Kantorovitch_JMP.pdf) and my CV (Kantorovitch_CV.pdf).
