Welcome to my GitHub Repository! My name is Ilja Kantorovitch, and I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at EPFL in Lausanne. I graduated with a PhD from Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona.

My research focuses on information frictions in financial markets and the macroeconomy. I am interested in understanding how information production and belief formation influence outcomes in financial markets and, subsequently, in the macroeconomy.
